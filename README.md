# Untitled Animal Game

## Introduction
Another game that I made for a college assignment. All the graphic was made by myself with soundFX found on the internet.  
I have a chance to know more about working with mobile, despite the fact there are still many bugs and flaws in the game.  
In the end, it's a great experience and I have learned a lot from it.  

## About the game
You are working in a cafe shop and your objective is to prepare the correct drinks for the animal customers.  
A drink is consisted of 3 ingredients based on colors so you have to be fast to look and drag the right ingredient to the cup.
